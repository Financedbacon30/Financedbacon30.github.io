        <h2>Brief Summary</h2>
        <p>Originally I am from Utah, there I have been to school for a year for business.
            <br> I have worked a government job, worked fast food, and worked an amusement park.
            <br>Once moving to Missouri, I have worked a retail job at Best Buy, worked a factory job, and now I am
            working at Bass Pro until I can get a degree related job.
        </p>


        <h2>Previous Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Personally I have not had much work experience in any field working with computers. <br>
            I did work at Best Buy for over a year and a half working in the phone department. <br>
            What I did the most over there was troubleshoot why customer's phones didn't work. <br>
            Because I don't have much experience in this field of work I do plan on applying and working as an intern
            for a few companies. <br>
            I work for Bass Pro Shops at the moment, and I am working to get into their IT or Computer Science branch at
            their headquartes when I am a Sophmore or Junior.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Plans for and after school</h2>
        <p>During school I hope to transfer over to Bass Pro's computer science team.
            <br> That way by the time I graduate I have a year or two of that kind of work when I am graduated.
            <br> I hope to graduate with my bachelors in the year 2026 or the beginning of 2027.
        </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <p>Some hobbies that I enjoy doing is playing videogames, and spending time outside in nature. I love to hike
            and fish.
            <br> I am originally from Utah, so I found lots of places to hike, camp, and fish. <br>
            When I am not doing these things I am usually spending time with my wife and my dog. <br>
