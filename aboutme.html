        <h2>Previous Work Experience</h2>
        <p>Personally I have not had much work experience in any field working with computers. <br>
            I did work at Best Buy for over a year and a half working in the phone department. <br>
            What I did the most over there was troubleshoot why customer's phones didn't work. <br>
            Because I don't have much experience in this field of work I do plan on applying and working as an intern for a few companies. <br>
            I work for Bass Pro Shops at the moment, and I am working to get into their IT or Computer Science branch at their headquartes when I am a Sophmore or Junior. 
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Some hobbies that I enjoy doing is playing videogames, and spending time outside in nature. I love to hike and fish.
            <br> I am originally from Utah, so I found lots of places to hike, camp, and fish. <br> 
        When I am not doing these things I am usually spending time with my wife and my dog. <br>
